# Root checks

### Android

These are the native checks:

- TEST KEYS
- DEV KEYS
- NON RELEASE KEYS
- DANGEROUS PROPS
- PERMISSIVE SELINUX
- SU EXISTS
- SUPERUSER APK
- SU BINARY
- BUSYBOX BINARY
- XPOSED
- RESETPROP(EXPERIMENTAL)
- WRONG PATH PERMITION
- HOOKS

### iOS

These are the checks that library detects in iOS while determining whether the device is rooted or not:

- Cydia Installed
- Undecimus Installed
- Sileo Installed
- Zbra Installed
- System path for Cydia/Shadow etc like tools
- Suspecious object classes

### False positives

Note that sometimes the `bool isFoundBusyboxBinary()` method can return a false positive.
This is cause the manufacturer of the device rom has left the busybox binary.
This alone doesn't mean that the device is rooted.

The following devices are known have the busybox binary on the stock rom:

- Part of the OnePlus Devices
- Part of the Xiaomi Devices
